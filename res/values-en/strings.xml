    <string name="title_start">Learn Italian in Italy, where else?</string>
    <string name="desc_start">The best place to learn Italian is in Italy. Where else? In Italy you can study the language and discover one of the most beautiful place in the world. Italy is unique in its diversity: you can study in a city of high culture, a town by the sea or a village in the mountains. Also you can choose a big city or a small city. You can even decide to study in a designated Unesco World Heritage Site. You may choose a Medieval town or a vivacious city.\n\nYes, Italy is rich with history, but "Il Bel Paese" is today composed of a vast array of cultures and communities, foods and colors, aromas and breathtaking landscapes.\n\nWith this app we invite you to discover the Italian language schools we offer and to choose the one that best fits your lifestyle, your travel style, and your learning style. You can go to Rome, Florence, Milan, "bella Sicily", to mysterious Sardinia or the myriad of other unique regions of Italy.</string>
